# Key-value Cache implementation with LRU removal

This project presents the implementation of a cache using a map for storage and a linked list for the removal mechanism

## Description

It includes the definitions of the nodes, used to store the key-value paires, they are stored in a hash using the provided key as key and the node as value. It also includes the definition of a linked list and the basic operations needed for the implementation: appendHead, dropTail, removeNode and push.
Finally it includes the cache itself an the set and get operations.
